# My Contact Book App

Hi! I created this app as my assignment for my MTM6407 Web Development IV class. It's a simple contact book where I can store my contacts and their information.

## What My App Can Do

- Add new contacts
- Search through my contacts
- Edit my contacts if I made a mistake
- Delete contacts I don't need anymore
- All my contacts are saved in my browser's local storage

## How I Built This

I used these tools for my project:
- Vue 3 (the newest version!)
- Vue Router 4 
- Local Storage (to save my contacts)
- Vite (it makes my development super fast)
- Nunito Sans font (because it looks nice)

## Notes to Self

If I need to work on this later:
- All my routes are in the router folder
- I save all contacts in localStorage
- My main views are in the views folder
- I used very basic Vue concepts I learned in class

I know it's not perfect, but I'm happy I made it work! ðŸ˜Š
